# IPS-Lib
IPS-Lib is a Library that can be implemented into any C++ project to generate IPS patches.

IPS-Lib uses the IPS32 standard.

There is an example main.cpp in the root of the project that shows you how to create a patch with it. 

# How to use it
All you need to do is copy the .h file into the project library folder (Or whereever you put Libraries) and include it. This library does make use of keystone engine so make sure that you link that library into your build system.
